TODAY:

[ ] Integrated test of sending both reliable cube commands 
    (create this cube, change color to this hue, etc.)
    (send each cube creation, then its color change)
    and unreliable cube commands (change this cube's pose)
      (it must be accounted for that these may 
      appear out of order to reliable commands,
      and thus could appear 
      before/after creation/destruction)
    A big grid of cubes would be great, like
    CreateCube 0
    ChangeHue  0 0.1
    CreateCube 1
    ChangeHue  1 0.2
    etc.
    ChangePose 0 (V3 0.1 0.2 0.3) (Quat 0.5 0.7 0.9 0.8)
    etc.
[ ] Think about expiration, which still may be most reliably done
    as a clientside/serverside combo thing where the client auto-expires
    cubes after they've existed for x seconds, and same with server.

[ ] Get OpenAL basics working, then try streaming libpd to it.
